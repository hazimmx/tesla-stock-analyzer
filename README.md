# tesla-stock-analyzer
A beginner-friendly project to estimate Tesla's fair stock value using real financial data (EPS, PER) from Yahoo Finance. Built with yfinance, pandas, and matplotlib via Google Colab.

## Features
- Fetches live EPS and PER data
- Calculates Fair Value = EPS Ã— PER
- Compares with current price
- Visualizes 1-year closing price
- Exports results to CSV

  It is a simple project so I am expected to expand this project in the future :D
